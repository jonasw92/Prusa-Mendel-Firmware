run arduino.exe

Go to File / preferences and disable "check for updates on startup" 
(disables the prompt for updating on startup everytime and this version is working fine.)

select "tools" / "board" / "sanguino"

turn off electronics. (unplug power to the gen6 via power cord or green connector on PCB)

look at the com port list in arduino "tools" / "serial port" and write down or remember.

turn on electronics.

select the COM port that is new in the list (this is the 3D printer/GEN6 Electronics). 

example: If list only contains COM3 with electronics off and with electronics on COM6 appears, then select the COM6.

File / Open - go to the Marlin Firmware and select the "Marlin.pde" file.

Now arduino will load all the firmware files, go to the 2nd tab "configuration.h".
Here you might want to change things (in the future): acceleration/home speeds/inverting axis/invert optos/max build dimensions(software endstops) etc.
For now you dont need change anything, it should be fine for an Orca 0.3.
For other machines (Mendel/Orca 0.2) check comments in configuration.h tab.

Then do:   File / "upload to I/U board".
you should get a message "uploading done".

In case you get a "out of sync" error,  hold the reset button on the GEN6 board while uploading.
And release the reset button, once the "binary size" pops up on the bottom in arduino screen.
Worst case try this multiple times, if still there are problems uploading, try uninstalling the ftdi driver and reinstall it.
